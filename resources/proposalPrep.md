# Guidelines on writing a proposal.

### a. Word or PowerPoint?

- The proposal could be written in either a document format(docx, pdf, rtf) or a presentation format(ppt). A presentation is preferred, as it gives an easy feel, and a sense of preparation to the client.

### b. What font?

- The proposal must be written with a font that’s easy to read, and easy on the eyes. Simple fonts should be used, no handwriting looking like fonts, or scribble-types, or too fancy ones. Good fonts to use could be:
  - Roboto
  - Open Sans
  - Montserrat
  - Lato
  - Poppins
  - Inter, …

### c. Does size really matter?

- Depending on whether the proposal is written on a document or a presentation, there is an ideal range of font-size that needs to be used that accounts for space, without compromising readability.
  - PowerPoint: body should be written in the 20-24pt font-size range with the titles having a 4pt advantage.
  - Word: body should be written in the 12-16pt range and titles should be a good 8pt greater.

### d. Can you give me some space?

- As a rule of thumb, choose a 1.25 line-spacing. The letters must be spaced out evenly and adequately. Remember this is a proposal not a book!

### e. Colors?

- Having colors on the proposal could add to the aesthetics aspect of it and could give the reader an easy feel, and even a professional look. However, I can’t stress this enough, don’t make it look like a coloring book!
- The color scheme should follow one color as a primary choice and another one as a secondary, ideally, colors that go along, should not have much contrast, that’s it.
- Most of the text should be written in regular black, and backgrounds of the pages should be, or at least close, to regular white.
- Colors could be added to the borders, a sectioned background, titles, graphs and illustrations.

# \***\*\*\*\*\***Contents of the proposal\***\*\*\*\*\***

# Cover Slide

- Must contain the name of the proposal while clearly addressing who this proposal is intended for.
- Must include the date, and contact information.
- NB: Must not be overloaded with unnecessary and distracting texts/pictures that don’t allude to the purpose of the proposal. Must have a clean and professional look.

# Project Summary

- contains the gist of the project and what it’s being built for.
- Has 2 parts
  ### 1. Objective
  1. Major Goals
  2. Target Audience/Demographic
  3. Problems to be solved
  4. Additional features
  ### 2. Components
  1. The major parts that make up the web app(frontend and backend)
  2. Security measures
  3. Software/Services/Packages(mostly paid) to be used
  4. Database/frameworks/libraries to be used
  - NB: Ideally, usage of these components will be listed out chronologically with respect to the development timeline of the project. As a result, it will allow for a clear understanding of how and why those components are needed while establishing a clear communication.

# Process and Deliverables

- Includes the necessary procedures to be taken in order to achieve the end result along with an estimated timeline.
- Each phase discussed in this part of the proposal have a specific deliverable that need to/can be returned/acquired by the concerning body(client).
- The phase must convey clear set of procedures, mostly higher level set of tasks, that can show clear output and be regarded as major milestones.
- Contains the following parts(Adjust if needed):

  ### 1. Timeline

  - A roughly estimated timeline that foresees the completion of the major steps/procedures of the project.
  - Although the goal is to meet the deadline, it should only be treated as a guideline and not be stressed, especially if it compromises the quality of the product.
  - Tip: It is better to have a much longer deadline than what’s expected, have more space to even add additional features that can bring more value to the product, and/or have a possibility of an earlier delivery.

  ### 2. Discovery

  - Communication with client on what the project is about, what problems it is supposed to fix, who it’s for, etc., basically, \***\*\*\*\*\***\*\*\***\*\*\*\*\***discovering\***\*\*\*\*\***\*\*\***\*\*\*\*\*** what the project is.
  - It is in this phase that the proposal gets written, requirements of the project get drafted and a sitemap possibly gets laid out.
  - Deliverable: Sitemap and Proposal

  ### 3. Design

  - The deliverable in this phase is mostly provided by the client or the client’s designer.
  - Mostly presented in a Figma file or a photoshopped image.(Basically anything that can portray what the end result should/could look like)
  - It must include designs for desktop, tablet* and mobile. (* not provided frequently, but should be mentioned nevertheless)
  - There might be times when design needs to be made, and in that case, it’s a good idea to have a user-centric mindset and a mobile-first-approach.
  - Must not compromise functionality of the app for pretty UI.
  - Deliverable: Design File(Figma, PSD, …)

    </aside>

    ### 4. Development

    - Explains the development phase of the project and how it will be laid out.
    - Must be written in ENGLISH! Many clients are not familiar with the technical terms used in the industry and can get overwhelmed. Try keeping it simple, descriptive and only go deeper if requested.
    - Having continuous integration and development pipeline can reduce the strain at time of delivery and can give the client the ability to view and comment on the project along the way.
    - Might be times where there are little to no progress to be REPORTED to the client, especially at the beginning, where most of the time is spent researching on tools best suited for the project. Thus, informing the client of the existence of such workflows is crucial.
    - If design change feels necessary, then inform both the client and the designer and make sure you provide a solution as well.
    - Deliverables:
      - Source Code
      - Integration/registration of required third party software
      - Working staging site
      - UI tested

    ### 5. Testing

    - This is the testing phase, where everything is made sure that it works as expected.
    - If testing is incorporated along with development, a separate phase may not be necessary.
    - Testing can(should) include both automated and user-manual testing.
    - Must make sure the view of the site works on every* device and browser. * not all devices, but the majority of the devices that are not outdated, and aren’t rare enough.

    ### 6. Deployment

    - This is the phase where the final site goes live.
    - Must set up analytics tools, SEO, SSL certificates, configure backup options, etc..
    - Wouldn’t be a bad idea to have one last testing round for the final product.
    - Deliverables:
      - SEO configs
      - Final site
      - Site registration with google

    ### 7. Follow Up

    - In this phase, any documentation, requirements, will be forwarded to the client.
    - The client should have a small window frame(typically, 30 days) to request a change or have a bug fixed on the site.
    - Outside the given time frame, if client requests a change/edit, then it must be treated as a new version of the project, and not a post-fix.
    - This part must be included in the price tag, should not be asked for a separate bill.
    - A video walkthrough can be provided, especially if it is necessary.
    - Deliverables:
      - Documentation
      - Training(video or audio walkthroughs)
      - Chance for a review within a limited time frame(depending on the size of the project)

# Price

- In this part of the proposal, a clear cut price is made and presented to the client.
- Although it’s hard to calculate a price, all components of the project, the timeline, possible strains and other problems need to be factored in.
- Price must be reasonable to both the developer and the client, but as a developer, putting a slightly higher price tag would be beneficial as it might help compensate for any unaccounted expenses, and could easily be repaid through the addition of features that can add value to the end product, if necessary.
- If client doesn’t agree with the price, a new price should be reached through negotiation by compromising features, but going below what is believed/should be the minimum is not ideal for both the client and the developer, as it might discourage good quality, eventually hurting both.
- Having a look through how other developers could price similar projects is also a great idea, could help set up for unnecessary costs down the line.
- The price should have an expiry date(a point in time where the price is no longer valid), and need to be outlined clearly as well. This duration should give the client enough time to look through the proposal, budget, and decide whether to continue or not. (A good 30 day constraint should do the trick)
- Most clients think that the price is inclusive of all the costs the website might incur. Although a price tag accounting for these factors could be made, most of these costs are controlled by other companies that can change the price at any time. In addition, there might arise costs that haven’t been accounted for in advance. As a result, the price should not include any services/products that are not DIRECTLY billed by the developer. Some of these costs might be:
  - Hosting
  - authentication
  - Databases and storage
  - Plugins
  - Marketing
  - Copywriting
  - Mail clients
  - Post-product maintenance,…

# Final Page

- This is the last page of the proposal.
- It can include a payment schedule if the clients choose to continue. However, for larger projects having a dedicated price to timeline deduction is ideal, but for small projects, payment split into two or three(or four, just make sure it isn’t a lot!), each tagged with a major milestone completion, should be fine.
- Having an initial deposit should also be mandatory.
- Giving the client a date for shipment will also be great. (Date shouldn’t be “December 10”, or something like that, but rather “early to mid December”)
- Some other components this page can include:
  - One, or at most two, good reviews.
  - Picture, should include entire face and preferably in a good mood.
  - Address and/or contact information
  - Links to previous works
- A call-to-action button that redirects the client directly to an email, or a contact method, should also be available; reduces friction.
